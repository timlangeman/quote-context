Often times when I'm reading something, I would like to get more context for a given quotation. In print, this is possible with footnotes, but hypertext has the potential to be interactive, expanding to to provide the reader with the 	surrounding text:</p><h3>Example</h3><p><strong>Click on the arrows</strong> to expand the quote:</p><a href="http://www.openpolitics.com/quote-context/cache/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Deuteronomy+8.html">Deuteronomy 8</a>:<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+8&amp;version=NRSV">one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord</blockquote><h3>Code</h3><script src="https://gist.github.com/timlangeman/e7629d5893168ab13222.js"></script>The jQuery plugin I created: <a href="https://github.com/timlangeman/quote-context/blob/master/js/quote-context.js">quoteContext</a><script type="text/javascript"> 	// Call plugin on all blockquotes:	jQuery( "blockquote" ).quoteContext(); </script><?php include("footer.php"); ?>
